A biographyTool application consists of the following sections:

    I: When you run app the page/form is opened with input fields on it. 
    You should enter data and information about you and fill the form. 
    After that you can go to submit button and new page will be opened.
  
WARNING: Some fields are mandatory. If you don't fill mandatory fileds with required data, 
or with data in specific pattern, you will have validation errors above the specific field! 
Read errors and fill data with required patterns or just fill mandatory fields without patterns.

    II: After clicking submit button new page is opened, which represents your bigraphy. 
    Your biography is generated with added CSS style. 
    The idea is to have CV or biography with added style.
